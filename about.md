### Kenza S.

Ph.D., ir.
Microfluidics & Synthetic Biology

As a Bio-engineer with proactive and creative problem-solving approach, I thrive in high-stakes environments that demand operational excellence working with multidisciplinary teams. 
I received my Ph.D. from Concordia University in 2022, researching microfluidics for applications in synthetic biology at the [Shih Microfluidics Lab](http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~sshih/index.html). After this, I worked with the team at [Alvea](http://alvea.bio) as a clinical product development lead. I'm commited to working on projects that make this world a safer place, through biosecurity (biological threaths, global health, community biology, open science and hardware) . I'm a community manager at [Bricobio](http://brico.bio). I also hold a board position at [SynBio Canada](https://www.synbiocanada.org/), and act as a judge and Safety and Security Commitee member at [iGEM](www.igem.org) HQ.

Into growing, building, and breaking things when necessary :)

Research interests: Microfluidics, synthetic biology, open science, food security, genetic privacy and global health.
