### Biosecurity

### Microfluidics

During my PhD I developed microfluidic devices (channel and digital microfluidics) for applications in synthetic biology at the Shih microfluidics lab.

### Non model organisms

During my Masters degree, I studied Arbuscular Mycorrhizal fungi with the intention of developing an engineering tolkit for it, and developed a fascination for these extremely complex living fossils. Growing them in vitro and studying them is quite fascinating.

### DIY Bio and community science projects
#### Kombucha engineering

A project at Bricobio where we were trying to improve the structural properties of bacterial cellulose biofilm by stabilizing a foreign bacteria in the community.

#### Bioilluminescent Beer
Or Foulbeer Green Pale Ale.
In collaboration with [Foulab](https://foulab.org), we've been brewing fluorescent beer with transformed yeast. That is nothing special... but... We're working towards bioilluminescent beer!

<br>
<br>
For brewing, we use transformed <i>S.cerevisiae</i> (GFP). The plan was to make a food safe transformed yeast strain that exports proteins that can trigger bioilluminescence in low quantity. I designed the yeast expression vector (2Âµ plasmid origin of replication, a ColE1 element, a marker gene (E. coli), a heterologous (methanol inducible) promoter, a termination signal and alpha-factor secretion leader peptide. )
