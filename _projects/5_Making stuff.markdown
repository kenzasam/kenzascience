<h3>About the homepage</h3>
<br>
The homepage shows a DNA sequence (currently MI transposon insertion flanking sequence of Drosophila melanogaster, hopefully to be updated to a FASTA file input from
 webpage visitor) that you can draw out using your cursor. It is an ongoing project, with which I hope to show both the complexity and intricacy of the basis of life: DNA. DNA, in a biological sense, means everything and nothing. DNA is the hard drive of our bodies, it contains our genes, the mutations we care, our ancestry. And every cell in your body, roughly has exactly the same genetic makeup. However, without the regulatory machinery around it, without the encoded RNA, we won't make proteins, and without proteins, well, there will not be life, since DNA can't even be transcribed into RNA without them... So, DNA on it's own, doesn't really mean much. And that becomes very clear, when you compare the sizes of different genomes. Plants can have DNA 10 times 'longer' than ours. And E.coli, has DNA only times smaller. The interactive tool, allows you to draw out a DNA sequence, a visual experience that brings you closer to the complexity of biology, and the essence of what it is to be.

<br>
The homepage was made using Processing and <a href="https://p5js.org" target="blank">p5.js</a>.
Processing is an easy to learn tool for creative coding and lets you draw onto a canvas using code, simply put. p5.js is based on Processing and allows you to transfer this canvas into a format that can be viewed online.
<br>
<!--
Here, a short tutorial on how to display p5.js on Github hosted Jekyll sites (I found this quite challenging and not much info is out there on this topic.) <br>
To be able to show this p5 canvas on your Github hosted Jekyll site, you can follow these steps:<br>
1. Write your code in p5.js.
Make a p5js folder in your Jekyll repository, containing your sketch file. You can find my sketch file here>.
I also currently require the text (DNA sequence) as a seperate txt file, placed in my main Jekyll repository.
2. Add Processing and p5.js functionality to your sites
Add this processing.js file to your main repository.
Add the following code to your header.html file:
This will add a new markdown class. Now you're basically able to mention in the markdown prematter, the p5 libraries you want to load on that page.
3.
Add this to your front matter.
